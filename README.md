## Crowdsourced Gameboy Advanced

Inspired by [Twitch Plays Pokemon](https://www.twitch.tv/twitchplayspokemon).

This brings the idea of crowdsourced gaming off of twitch and onto a more global platform, the web browser.

### Building Python Emulator

#### Docker

Make sure you have docker installed, then run the following in the root directory of the repository:
```bash
docker build . -t crowdsourced-gba
docker run -p 3000:8888 -e LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/emulator -v `pwd`:/home crowdsourced-gba
```

The first line builds the Docker image, called `crowdsourced-gba`, with all the dependencies listed in the Dockerfile.
The second line loads the build Docker image and performs the necessary build commands to build the emulator. It then starts up the python server with the port 8888 exposed in the container. The exposed port is then connected on the local machine on port 3000.

#### OSX

First, install all the dependencies in `requirements.txt`

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

mgba, the emulator, has its own dependencies.
```bash
brew install cmake ffmpeg imagemagick libzip qt5 sdl2 libedit
```

The following commands are to produce the `mgba` python library.
```bash
cd emulator
./osx_make.sh
make mgba-py
```

There should now be a `python` directory, this contains the source code to install as a python module.
```bash
pip install -e ./python
```

To test, running the following command should not produce any errors.

```bash
python -c "import mgba"
```

__Note__: If you're getting an `ImportError` due to importing mgba, try setting the following environment variable to the directory where the dylib files are stored (denoted as `MGBA_DYLIB_PATH`).

```bash
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=MGBA_DYLIB_PATH
```

### Dependencies
